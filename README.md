Built on the Watson APIs
and this [tone analyzer demo](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/tone-analyzer-nodejs).

## Install this plugin:

1. Download and run N1

2. Clone this repository (Make sure you have `git` installed and available in
   your system path)

3. From N1's menu, select `Developer > Install a Package Manually...`
   From the dialog, choose the directory of this plugin to install it!

   > When you install packages, they're moved to `~/.nylas/packages`,
   > and N1 runs `apm install` on the command line to fetch dependencies
   > listed in the package's `package.json`
